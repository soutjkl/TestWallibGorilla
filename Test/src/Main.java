//1. create an interface called "Shape" with a method called "draw" that takes no arguments and return void.interface
//2. create three classes that implement the  "Shape" interface: "Circle", "Rectangle", ans "Square".
// each class should have it own "draw" method thet prints a message indicating that the shape is being drawn.
//3. create a class calles "ShapeMaker" that has three public methods; "drawCircle",  "drawRectangle", and "drawSquare". Each of these
//methods call the appropiate "draw" method of the corresponding class (Cicle, Rectangle, or Square).
//4. Create a class called "FecadeDemo" that has a "main" method. in this method, create an instance of "shapeMaker" and call each of its "draw" method (drawCircle, drawRectangle, and drwSquare)
